# Requirements

* A web server such as nginx or apache2 with rewriteEngine module enabled. Note that we had problems configuring Nginx so you might need to debug the autogenerated config file.
* At least php 7.0
* Mysql or mariadb.
* Composer (php package manager). [Install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download)
* A web browser
* A server application which supports the Credit Commons API. eg the [Reference implementation](https://gitlab.com/credit-commons-software-stack/cc-node);

# Installation procedure
  * Download this package from gitlab to your server.
  * Create a virtualhost in your web server config (examples below)
  * Tell your browser this domain is hosted locally and not online. Usually this is done by appending to /etc/hosts something like ``127.0.0.1 myccclient``
  * Navigate in your browser to the new virtualhost
  * The default users in the reference implementation are admin, alice & bob, each with auth key '123'


# Example config
## Apache
``<VirtualHost *:80>
  ServerName myccclient
  DocumentRoot /var/www/myccclient
</VirtualHost>``
## Nginx
@todo
What about .htaccess and nginx?
