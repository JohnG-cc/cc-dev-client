# Reference Client

This php application implements the [Credit Commons protocol](https://gitlab.com/credit-commons-software-stack/cc-php-lib/-/blob/master/docs/credit-commons-openapi-3.0.yml) from the client side and was developed in tandem with the reference node. Playing the role of leaf in a credit commons tree, it stores no data except perhaps login credentials.
